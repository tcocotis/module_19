<p>The Big Cat Trader ...</p>
<p>I have not done this in over 20 years. But not much has changed, except of course that they invented Javascript, and Java, and Python, and Machine Learning and automated stock market trading....</p>
<p>I built an AWS EC2 system with an NVIDIA GPU over the weekend. Still trying to get the GPU to run. I need to do more Googling.
